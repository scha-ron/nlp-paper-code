# RAG-based Educational Guidance Assistant

A simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to demonstrate how an AI assistant can provide personalized guidance for Ugandan nationals pursuing computer science studies in German higher education institutions.

## Purpose

The primary goal is to address the information gap that Ugandan students face when navigating the complex German higher education system. This assistant aims to provide:

- Personalized, step-by-step guidance for CS program applications
- Clear information about admission requirements and procedures  
- Language proficiency requirements and examination options
- Document preparation and qualification recognition processes

## System Features

- **RAG Architecture**: Combines retrieval and generation for contextually relevant responses
- **Curated Knowledge Base**: Built from selected official German university sources and DAAD information
- **Local LLM Integration**: Uses Qwen3-1.7B model via Ollama for offline processing
- **Semantic Search**: Employs all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings for document retrieval
- **Evaluation Framework**: Includes simple testing methodology for system assessment

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **LangChain**: Framework for building the RAG pipeline
- **Chroma**: Vector database for document storage and retrieval
- **HuggingFace Embeddings**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for semantic text representation
- **Ollama**: Local LLM runtime with `qwen3:1.7b` model
- **PyPDF**: PDF document processing for knowledge base creation
